# Java


The line scanner.skip("(\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?"); is used to skip any newline characters or 
other line separator characters that might be present in the input stream. Let me break down what each part of this line does:

    scanner.skip: This method is used to skip over a specified pattern in the input. It's often used to skip over whitespace or 
    newline characters.

    (\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?: This is a regular expression pattern that matches various newline characters. 
    Let's break it down further:

        \r\n: This matches the Windows-style newline sequence (carriage return followed by newline).

        |: This is the logical OR operator in regular expressions, meaning it matches either the pattern on its left or the pattern on its right.

        [\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085]: This is a character class that matches any of the specified newline characters. Here:
            \n: Line feed (LF), used in Unix and Linux.
            \r: Carriage return (CR), used in older Mac systems.
            \u2028: Line separator.
            \u2029: Paragraph separator.
            \u0085: Next line (NEL).

        ()?: This is a group with a question mark at the end, making it optional. 
        It means that the entire group of newline characters is optional.

So, scanner.skip("(\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?"); skips over any combination of newline characters or 
line separators before reading the actual input. 
It's a common practice to include this kind of skipping when working with input to ensure that any leading whitespace or 
newlines are ignored before reading the desired input.
